# secretbox-operator
Secretbox-operator is a k8s operator which generates secret, configmap, deployment and service for a single node secretbox instance.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

### Install controller

```
git clone https://github.com/pavel1337/secretbox-operator
cd secretbox-operator
kubectl apply -f dist/
```

### Create secretbox instance

You can create a sample secretbox instance by running:
```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: secretbox.ipvl.de/v1
kind: Secretbox
metadata:
  name: sample
spec:
  size: 1
EOF
```
